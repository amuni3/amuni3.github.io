I have been painting since I was five. My work falls under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_art" target="blank">"Na√Øve art"</a> category and draws inspiration from Indian culture and traditions. I have worked in several mediums including poster colors, water colors, oil paints and even ink and organic colors.

Over the years I have won many national and international awards and scholarships. From 2004 to 2008, I was a recipient of the Cultural Talent Search Scholarship Scheme (CTSSS) implemented by the Center for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT), India. I was invited by the Government of Portugal
to attend the 1<sup>st</sup> International Juvenile Art Workshop in Penela, Portugal.

Below are some of my selected paintings.
