This semester long project was part of Dr. David Anderson's "Introduction to Electrical
and Computer Engineering" class. Along with two other teammates, I programmed a
Mindstorms NXT robot to traverse a race course while picking up certain colored balls.

Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VjdRYz2Wlcvideo" target="blank"> video </a>
from the edge detection trial.

This project gave me an appreciation of the difficulty involved in implementing tasks that
are easily carried out my humans, on robotic platforms. I liked this challenge and it motivated me to
further pursue research in automation and controls.
