I am a graduate student at the Swiss federal Institute of Technology (ETH) pursuing a
Master of Science in Robotics, Systems and Control under the supervision of Dr. Roland Siegwart.
My research interests lie in the area of machine learning and controls. I recently completed
a project in designing safe learning-based controllers for constrained systems with Dr. Melanie Zeilinger
at the <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-zeilinger.html" target="blank">Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology with a
minor in Robotics. During my bachelors, I was a Teaching Assistant for Differential equations and a
Research Assistant with the Georgia Tech Systems Lab under Dr. Fumin Zhang. I spent three months as a
visiting student researcher at the Autonomous Systems Lab in ETH Zurich, through the
<a href="http://thinkswiss.tumblr.com/About" target="blank">ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I was also on the co-op track and completed a Robotics and Image Processing co-op with the
<a href="http://www.fptd.gatech.edu/" target="blank">Food Processing Technology Division</a> under
Georgia Tech Research Institute, where I developed autonomy
algorithms for a robotic system to monitor chickens in a poultry grow out house. For my Undergraduate thesis,
I analysed different ways of using vision based systems to create 3D models of chickens
with the goal of evaluating the correlation between size and weight of birds.

When I'm not working with robots and computers, I love reading, hiking and
