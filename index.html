I am a Visiting Researcher at
<a href="http://pierrelucbacon.com/group/" target="blank">MILA, Quebec AI Institute</a>,
advised by Dr. Pierre-Luc Bacon.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also a graduate student at ETH Zurich, pursuing a <!--EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) -->
Master of Science in Robotics, Systems and Control. My primary research objective is
to develop practical theory that leverages concepts from machine learning and optimal
control theory to develop intelligent control systems.
<br/>
<br/>
I recently completed my masters thesis with Dr. Andreas Krause in the domain of safe policy search in
high-dimensional spaces. Before that, I worked on safe and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms
for constrained dynamical systems with Dr. Melanie Zeilinger.
<br/>
<br/>
I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology with a
minor in Robotics. During my bachelors, I was a Teaching Assistant for Differential equations and a
Research Assistant with the Georgia Tech Systems Lab under Dr. Fumin Zhang. I spent three months as a
visiting student researcher in the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH, through the
<a href="http://thinkswiss.tumblr.com/About" target="blank">ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I was also on the co-op track and completed a Robotics and Image Processing co-op with the
<a href="http://www.fptd.gatech.edu/" target="blank">Food Processing Technology Division</a> under
Georgia Tech Research Institute, where I developed autonomy algorithms for a robotic system
 to monitor chickens in a poultry grow-out house.
<!--- For my Undergraduate thesis,
I analysed different ways of using vision based systems to create 3D models of chickens
with the goal of evaluating the correlation between size and weight of birds.--->

When I'm not working with robots and computers, I love reading, hiking and
