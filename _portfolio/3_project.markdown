Under the supervision of Dr. Michael E. West at RobotLab under Georgia Tech Research Institute, my senior design project included developing a multi-agent system for efficient underwater search missions. Along with five teammates, I helped design and prototype a system that allows multiple AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) called HydraBots, to collaborate with one another in an underwater setting through a combination of infrared signals.

The project consisted of two main goal: First, to build cost-effective HydraBot prototype with the ability to transmit and receive data through infrared communication as well as to detect their neighboring robot(s) using a color detection vision mechanism. Moreover, each robot should function for upto one hour on a single charge. To simplify the objective, the project only considered two-dimensional propeller motion.

Once the robots were built the second goal consisted of providing the swarm of HydraBots the capability to perform a consensus algorithm by bringing all robots to a common rendezvous point. Our team was able to successfully build three AUVs and demonstrate underwater consensus where each Hydrabot starts at a random location and aims to reach the centroid of the triangle formed by the location of each bot.

My Fascination with robotics started with a semester long project in Dr. David Anderson's
"Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering" class. Along with two other teammates, I programmed a
Mindstorms NXT robot to traverse a race course while picking up certain colored balls. Here is a

from the edge detection test.

Recently in Dr. Hamblen's "Embedded Systems Design" class, I used Mbed microcontroller to perform basic movements,
forward, reverse, clockwise and anti-clockwise turns on a two wheeled toy robot. Here is a

This project gave me an appreciation of the difficulty involved in implementing tasks that
are easily carried out my humans, on robotic platforms. I liked this challenge and it motivated me to
further pursue research in automation and controls nxt.png   

Robotics kits are a quick and inexpensive way of learning basic functionality of various sensors, actuators and designing
simple algorithms to understand robotics. I want further study the benefits of such toolkits as learning platforms and create
personal robots that integrate seamlessly into homes and classrooms. -->
