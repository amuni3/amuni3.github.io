I worked on the design and control of Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimp (GT-MAB) with
Dr. Fumin Zhang in <a href="http://gtsr.gatech.edu/" target="blank"> GTSR</a> lab at Georgia Tech.

I was in charge of system identification and controller design to control the altitude of the blimp.
I figured out a simple linear model for the blimp and then collected large amount of data to identify
the parameters of the model and then generate PID gains for the blimp controllers. This was done using
the System Identification Toolbox in MATLAB/Simulink. This work helped us win the third position at
IEEE Control System Society's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M-V4GOFNDA" target="blank">video </a>
submission contest.

Later I was involved with the development of a smaller version of the blimp, where I contributed in
electronic hardware design & development, software development and design and 3D printing the
mechanical parts of the Nano blimp.

For this work, I was awarded the <a href="http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/content/presidents-undergraduate-research-awards" target="blank">
President's Undergraduate Research Award</a> in Summer 2015 and Spring 2016.
