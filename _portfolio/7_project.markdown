My Fascination with robotics started with a semester long project in Dr. David Anderson's
"Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering" class. Along with two other teammates, I programmed a
Mindstorms NXT robot to traverse a race course while picking up certain colored balls. Here is a

from the edge detection test.

Recently in Dr. Hamblen's "Embedded Systems Design" class, I used Mbed microcontroller to perform basic movements,
forward, reverse, clockwise and anti-clockwise turns on a two wheeled toy robot. Here is a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh1uhro9YKU" target="blank"> video </a> of the trial.

Robotics kits are a quick and inexpensive way of learning basic functionality of various sensors, actuators and designing
simple algorithms to understand robotics. I want further study the benefits of such toolkits as learning platforms and create
personal robots that integrate seamlessly into homes and classrooms.

<!---This project gave me an appreciation of the difficulty involved in implementing tasks that
are easily carried out my humans, on robotic platforms. I liked this challenge and it motivated me to
further pursue research in automation and controls nxt.png-->
