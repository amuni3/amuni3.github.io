I am a first year Computer Science PhD. student with <a href="https://pierrelucbacon.com/" target="blank">
    Dr. Pierre-Luc Bacon</a> at the University of Montreal and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="blanck">
Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms, Mila</a>. Previously, I was a research intern at
<a href="https://nnaisense.com/" target="blank">NNAISENSE</a>, working at the intersection of control theory,
robotics and deep learning.

<!-- I was a Visiting Researcher at <a href="http://pierrelucbacon.com/group/" target="blank">MILA, Quebec AI Institute</a>,
working on Antimicrobial Peptide synthesis, with Dr. Pierre-Luc Bacon. -->
<br/>
<br/>
I recently graduated from ETH Zurich, with a <!--EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) -->
MSc. in Robotics, Systems and Control. I did my masters thesis with Dr. Andreas Krause
in the domain of safe policy search in high-dimensional spaces. I also worked on safe and efficient
reinforcement learning algorithms for constrained dynamical systems with Dr. Melanie Zeilinger.
<br/>
<br/>
I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology with a
minor in Robotics. During my bachelors, I was a Teaching Assistant for Differential equations and a
Research Assistant with the Georgia Tech Systems Lab under Dr. Fumin Zhang. I spent three months as a
visiting student researcher in the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH, through the
<a href="http://thinkswiss.tumblr.com/About" target="blank">ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
At Georgia Tech, I completed three rotations of Robotics and Image Processing co-op at the
<a href="http://www.fptd.gatech.edu/" target="blank">Food Processing Technology Division</a> under
Georgia Tech Research Institute, where I developed autonomy algorithms for a robotic system
 to monitor chickens in a poultry grow-out house.
<!--- For my Undergraduate thesis,
I analysed different ways of using vision based systems to create 3D models of chickens
with the goal of evaluating the correlation between size and weight of birds.--->

When I'm not working with robots and computers, I love reading, hiking and

        <!--- My primary research objective is
to develop practical theory that leverages concepts from machine learning and optimal
control theory to develop intelligent  control systems. --->
